# NOTICE BOARD PARSER 

## v0
man, this was just some code in a single file, doing what was intended

## v1
logic from v0, but arranged properly

## Going forth
v0/alternate_main.py contains post logic, compared to forum and posts

----

update last as the first one this time

traverse next page using notice_start till last is found

----

if i attach images, gdrive will be used, but locally i can delete

why not just delete the mails??

to avoid this, i can upload on server, but then not delete them

---

if use a cron, lets say every x mins

when getting the list of urls, i can check for the notices posted in last x+1 mins


## IMP
- in v1, make a dir named data and one named logs
    - in data, add files last_notice.txt and last_post.txt
- in v1, make a file named my_secrets.py and add the required variables there, as you run the code
